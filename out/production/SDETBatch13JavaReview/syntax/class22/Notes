What is method overloading in Java?
With the help of method overloading we can have many methods with same name but different parameters in a class.

Why we should use MethodOverloading?
1.cleaner code
2.flexibility for end users.

How to use MethodOveloading?
we can overload a method by changing three things:
1.number of parameters
2.change the datatype of parameters
3.we can change the sequence of parameters

example

class Calculator{
int method(int num1,int num2){
return num1+num2;

}

}

Rules:
1.Method names should be same but parameters should be different.
2.we can't overload a method by just changing its return type.
3.we can also overload constructors by following the same rules.

Method Overriding

What is it?
happens when same method exists inside the parent class and the child class.

Why we should override a method?
If we are inheriting from a parent class and we don't like the implementation of a method from
the parent class we can provide our own implementation. Sometimes it's done to improve the performance of code.

How we can override a method?
when we inherit from a class we just need to rewrite that method inside the child class.All should be same except
the body and access modifiers.

Rules:
1. for Override we must inherit from a class.
2. The method in the parent class that we want to override must be exactly
the same as method in the child class only the access modifiers can be different.
3.The access modifiers in the child class can only be increased with respect to the visibility for example
we can change default to protected or to public but we can't make it private.
4.if something is not inherited then we can't override it for example private methods and constructors.
